# Notebooks

## Style
- Use snake_case file names, e.g. `notebooks/example_notebook.ipynb`.
- Break cells into logical operational chunks. Consider notebook state (e.g. "what if I run this cell again without running the ones before?").
- Use markdown cells to delineate sections and describe what's going on in the notebook.

## Scratch Notebooks Directory
To avoid committing personal prototyping notebooks, you can work in `notebooks/scratch/`, which is in the .gitignore, so notebooks in this directory will be ignored by git by default.

## TODO
- [ ] `nbstripout`
